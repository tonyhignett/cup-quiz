## Notes

- I have not implemented a "splash" screen for the rounds in Activity 2. There is an inconsistency: the written requirements say "the user is prompted to take the next round", but the wireframes imply a screen which lcears automatically. In reality I'd get clarification on this requirement; here I'm working at the weekend so I don't expect to get it in time.
